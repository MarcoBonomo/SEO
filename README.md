Wayback Machine URL Publication Date Finder
A Python script that determines the exact publication date of any web page by querying the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine API.

Overview
This tool helps you discover when a URL was first published on the web by retrieving the earliest available snapshots from the Wayback Machine. Simply provide a URL, and the script will return the first 10 timestamps showing when the page was initially crawled and archived.
